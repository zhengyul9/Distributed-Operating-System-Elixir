Run the code:
1. Extract the zip file
2. mix run project3.exs numNodes numRequests

    numNodes - integer e.g. 1-10000
    numRequests - integer e.g. 1-100
	
What is working?
The tapestry algorithm is working abd the maximum numbers of hops that traversed for all requests for all nodes is printed. 

Largest network:
The largest network we managed to deal with is the network with 11050 nodes and 10 requests. 
The largest number of requests we tested is 100. It may handle the larger numbers but takes more time.
